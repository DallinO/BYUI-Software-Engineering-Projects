# Overview

This project is design to test my basic understanding of Rust syntax by creating a simple number guessing game. The program selects a random number between 1 and 100 and then prompts the user to enter a guess. The program will then inform the user if their guess is too high, too low, or the correct number.

# Development Environment

For this project I installed Rust from the official Rust website. I am using the Visual Code enviroment with the rust-analyzer and CodeLLDB extensions.

# Future Work

These are a couple things I would like to expand on in the future.

- Add a word guessing game option
- Create a more visual appealing output
- Reverse roles where the user picks a number and the computer has to guess it.
- Compete against the computer to guess the number in the fewest tries.
