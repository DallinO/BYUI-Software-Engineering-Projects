# Overview

The purpose of this project is to test my knowledge and skill in object oriented programming. This program was design to track the game data of a real life turn-based strategy game inspired from my siblings who love playing legos. The program tracks the each players health, credits and thier collection of units on the field. It also tracks each individual units health, movement, range, class, damage and so forth.

# Development Environment

I developed this program in Windows Studio. The program uses the terminal as the user interface.

# Future Work

These are a couple things I would like to expand on in the future.

- Create a an application to use as the graphical interface
- Add a picture to display the selected unit.
- Save all data to an external file to be reloaded.
- Add better guards for invalid input.
