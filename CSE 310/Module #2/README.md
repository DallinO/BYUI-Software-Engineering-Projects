# Overview

This project is design to test my basic understanding of Java syntax by creating a the "Snake" game. The program generaes a board and randomly places the snake body and apple. The user direscts the head of the snake to the apple, growing the body. The game ends when the user hits a wall or runs into its own body.

# Development Environment

For this project I installed the Extention Pack for Java from the extensions window in Visual Code. I am using the Visual Code enviroment and the Java SE Development kit.

# Future Work

These are a couple things I would like to expand on in the future.

- Add a score board.
- Increase the size of the board and elements.
- Add directional based body parts and head.
- Add point pop up after apple consumption.
